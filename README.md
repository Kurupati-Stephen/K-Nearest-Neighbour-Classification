# K-Nearest-Neighbour-Classification
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To understand and implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for solving classification problems using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

ðŸªœ Step-by-Step Process
âœ… Step 1: Choose a Classification Dataset
Select a dataset suitable for classification. In this case, a dataset (such as the Iris dataset) is used, which includes labeled features and categories. The dataset is stored locally at the path:
C:\Users\kurup\Downloads\archive (4)

âœ… Step 2: Load and Understand the Dataset
Read the dataset and explore it to understand its structure â€” number of features, target labels, missing values, and data types.

âœ… Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Drop Unnecessary Columns: Remove non-informative columns like IDs or serial numbers.

Split Data: Separate features (independent variables) from the target (class/label).

Feature Scaling: Normalize the data using standardization techniques because KNN is distance-based and sensitive to scale.

âœ… Step 4: Split the Dataset
Divide the dataset into a training set and a testing set, usually with an 80:20 ratio. The training set is used to train the KNN model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

âœ… Step 5: Train the KNN Classifier
Use the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to fit the model on the training data.

Choose an initial value of K (e.g., K=3) to begin with.

âœ… Step 6: Make Predictions
Use the trained KNN model to predict the classes of the test data.

âœ… Step 7: Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the performance of the classifier using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (precision, recall, f1-score)

These metrics help determine how well the model is performing in classifying the data.

âœ… Step 8: Tune the K Value
Test the model with different values of K (e.g., 1 to 20).

Track the error rate or accuracy for each K.

Plot error rate vs. K to find the optimal K that provides the best performance.

âœ… Step 9: Visualize Decision Boundaries
For datasets with 2 or 3 features, visualize the decision boundaries of the classifier to understand how it separates classes in the feature space. This helps interpret the model's behavior and decisions.

âœ… Step 10: Draw Conclusions
Analyze how the model's accuracy changes with different K values.

Observe how well it separates different classes visually.

Identify any limitations or improvements needed for the model.
